# KindKart

KindKart is a browser extension designed to help the average consumer be a better shopper. When visiting an online retail site, KindKart reports on five major ethical pillars of the business, as well as its overall commitment to ethics. If the business is deemed unethical, KindKart automatically suggests alternative, more ethically-sourced websites where consumers can find similar or even identical products. KindKart provides exclusive coupons and promo codes, enhancing usersâ€™ shopping experience and rewarding them for becoming better shoppers. Over-time, KindKart keeps track of your savings and reminds you to use it for good by providing the option to donate those funds to a charity of choice.
